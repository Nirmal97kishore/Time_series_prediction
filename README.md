#Time Series Prediction using Deep Learning(LSTM)
#The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using a deep 
learning framework (TensorFlow) to forecast future sales from historical time series data. 
We aim to select a suitable deep learning algorithm to accurately predict future time steps 
and evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
