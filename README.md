    Hyperparameter tuning 
  I have adjust the epochs count=80, batch_size=20, learning rate=0.001 ,adding 
hidden layer units , Dropout function and callback functions like (Early stopping) to tune 
the model and prevent that model learn less Noice and more Signals to avoid underfitting 
or overfitting.
